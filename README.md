BASS_new
========

A new implementation of the BASS project with jQuery.js

This is an auditory table project to allow blind users to browse non-visually through tables. Control is keyboard based, and the audio emitted is intended to be self-guiding. This project was part of a study for a Ph.D. dissertation at Florida International University in Miami.
